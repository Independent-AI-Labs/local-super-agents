# 🌟 Local **Super-Agents**: ***Secure** Practical AGI for the **Real World***

![](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/local-super-agents/blob/main/res/built_on.png)
## 🛡️ Safety First!
In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, prioritizing **security**, **data ownership** and **transparency** becomes crucial for the safety of any enterprise and end-user environment. By bringing **secure, practical AI automation capabilities** to consumer and edge hardware, the **Local AI **Super-Agents**** platform empowers individuals and organizations to take back control of their data, staying ahead of the curve and reducing costs along the way.

We offer a comprehensive approach to the development of **safe, agentic AI systems** at scale, building on top of leading **FOSS** solutions and architectures. Designed with a relentless focus on **compliance** with global security standards and a commitment to openness, the platform integrates **state-of-the-art language and vision models** with **privacy-first automation tools** and foundational **digital twin** technology.

Our goal is to build a system, capable of complex task comprehension and real-time decision-making, that integrates safely and seamlessly with user and public data. Agent interactions via familiar communication channels, such as **email**, **instant messaging** and **web portals**, as well as full **audit trail** and **sandboxing** features are built in to facilitate faster adoption in high-dynamic and enterprise environments.

Powered by our novel **Outcome-Driven Process Modelling** and **Reasoning** framework, **Super-Agents** are more than runtime-generated programs. They are purpose-driven **digital entities**, capable of simulating and understanding practical scenarios by employing various **goal decomposition**, **self-reflection** and **pro-active solution exploration** techniques. More importantly - they can do so in a way that is inspired by our own human cognitive ability, **learning as they go** and enabling advanced AI-powered functionality across a wide range of personal and professional contexts. 

We invite you to explore an ecosystem where technology serves its rightful purpose: to **empower users**, not exploit them. Through ****natural-language automation**** of **distributed learning**, **secure data management**, and **software integration**, we aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and the **real-world needs** of individuals and businesses.

## 🏗️ Development Approach

We believe that the future of software is defined by **security-driven development**, **evolving architectures**, and **on-demand functionality** that can be rapidly deployed, scaled, and replaced as needed. This, and the shift towards **distributed** workloads emphasizes granular access controls, continuous monitoring, and **Zero Trust** principles to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance. As AI further integrates into every facet of computing—from edge devices to enterprise backends—**robust encryption**, **hardware-based security enclaves**, and **real-time vulnerability assessments** become non-negotiable requirements. In this evolving landscape, building software with **defense in depth**, **secure-by-design** practices, and automated checks not only fortifies systems but also lays the groundwork for sustainable, adaptive solutions in an era where functionality must be both **immediate** and **inherently trustworthy**.

Finally, by further ensuring that your AI operates **securely and transparently** on **local or self-hosted** systems, you can eliminate the risks of **centralized data collection** and intrusive **surveillance**.

> **Benchmark Datasets (pre-indexed, will be included):**  
> - *Mother of All Movie Reviews* (structured, ~56M unique rows, ~1.3B searched)  
> - *EUR-Lex Energy Legislation* (average ~500 KB each, ~17K unique documents, ~400K searched)

> **CPU Core Scaling:**  
> - Average core scaling will depend on many factors including CPU architecture, power budget, available cache, etc. Scaling beyond physical cores is usually very detrimental to performance.
> - E.g. on heterogeneous, power limited platforms like the i9-14900F, the per-core scaling factor rapidly drops from ~80% at 2 concurrent processes to <60% at 8 and below 25% when all logical cores are used...
> - Disk read times also have a significant impact, especially with structured data. Naturally, you'll need a high-performance SSD to get the most out of the solution.
> - Generally, server-class CPUs are more consistent with their scaling and consumer-grade chips tend to have better single-core performance.
