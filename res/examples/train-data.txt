Scheri scans Mare’s work station, pulling on the pen grip to slide it across her papers on his last visit as if by invisible hand pulling him across the page towards one particular stack of files. His lips narrow and curl over each tooth into a ferocious smile, reflective of that infernal look in those freaky gill creatures’ eyes. The room grows gloomy, the very air breathing heavier upon us with its oppressiveness. Everything is bathed in this dreary hue, her blue computer screen only showing bits and parts of cryptic codes, various symbols that meant something, a foreign script lumped with bits of Latin phrases which shift, making everything seemingly alien to you now than a scant seconds ago. In the distance, Vilon lights up the entire north area in blue, illuminating the array of ships there, and maybe its red counter-lights too for steer. Shivering, but somehow manfully pulling against the reeling vertigo, you try to communicate again via radio

Some familiar name scrolls above, last contact information gets blurred. Something happens right over the eastern side out of frame. Flash of blinding blue, things almost go back in position, but the heart treading water swimmers watch carefully to feel for new unheard bending under foot where the water stirring comes back when it started. Distortions, swallowings of worlds into that pale oblige - memory with holes patched over holes within itself - fear or false-hood they seem. Implication too wide, taking-up more space than sound waves should without need for precepts - reimagines bending noir that moves too slow amidships waiting for signals to bleep out - we stay lost, whimsical children pretending to comprehend chaos with cocky bluntness in an offhand grasp... A scaly beetle draws its hindmost legs, *quack*, wham-crack! Sends jars smashing against ceiling corners, k-rash clattering to ground dust. Unseamed corners hide wings nesting restlessly like starving vampires- sigh, skitter-splurrrr-oo! Ratlike monuments upended smash onto jagged steps to room with glut of frilled chintz strewn crook'd anklets scattered feckless. All lay scattered before us: life undone & cropped uneven. Disheveled fragments crack into burst fragments still breathing strange: all whited and ready to swallow us whole while that big invisible wheel grinds ceaselessly!

History: In the world where music had moved beyond being “simple” entertainment, there existed a composer named Pacobel. It seems Pacobel possessed a bit of the dark side along with his exceptional genius for composing magnificent symphonies. When his peers refused to hear a composition born from this sinister soul, he brought a chime from the eerie swamp land he inhabited (where legend foretold evil), merged the tune with this unearthly magic. Hence was created the world's first, most awe-inspiring, symphonic overtures under his infamous nom de plume known throughout this twisted universe—Pieces for Ghouls, Devils & Vampyres! To put his “opening music” together for each eerie live symphonic recital meant employing new pitch resonance dynamics in gothic sonic terrain. Of the sinister sounds crafted by Pacobel, the “Demonic Violins Sonata,” followed by "The 'Death and Doom' organ ode" and rounded off by “The thunder and hell scream solo guitar wailing melody” was what makes "Darktonal Distress" his most menacing track so far. The album, for me, served an effective bridge between my love of instrumental arrangements that invade the space and inhabit me with sinister energy and ambiance, combined with my penchant for traditional pop melodies.
Most of Pacobel’s current offering relies upon a so-so soprano being conducive towards instilling haunted horror sounds in an odd fusion that laps into each song but works effectively in context. Now a longer synopsis wouldn’t hurt either right? But knowing what makes his eeriness what it is, as this track could become your haunted chamber of hordors; something an ascetical divination may presage but one can’t ignore! That there lies a rough rock track outfitted in occult solicitous tinges - do share in this sick sonance or run with hasty steps where “There Will Not be Salvage”. The bass note simulating a dark plumage can be more infectious than infectious microbial virulent strains and more haunting.
The album itself is more than a mere collection of musical scores. Instead the compilation is a subconscious narrative which tells many stories, for each tune evokes a unique feeling in me that reflects varied aspects of life, or indeed that stirs nostalgic reminiscence as I go into flashbacks. Overall though, as I go along listening and perhaps remembering events through the passage of life as triggered by the different sounds in the notes, I learn, as if there was always a new lesson out there awaiting in life itself. As music weaves its symphonic orchestra in tune to capture our discord, it provides insightful solution to dissent. In art is its antidote - the solution to dissatisfaction. So too is in melodious notes its prescription - cure for the common compliancy. All in all through life's constant vicissitudes and by life's veritable vicarage of characters where character denotes not only as your traits but as context too within those respective circles we fall in, yes life then must indeed not only bear its burden, but with patience through adversity build resilience with persistance through adversities for character denotes not so much where you stand as context in communities where you network but more to do with how much of what adversities you actually can absorb, which qualities do you maintain whilst absorbing the challenges of living everyday? (Collateral Rising blog November 8, 2016 ) I work with community teams doing and being… together. Facing headlines filled with rants about gunplay in school hallways from grade six through graduate years… about maladies looming and on life sustenance… how to bring a balance to our collective emotions is quite the exercise for individuals… as communities… as a civil society we must expand beyond facebook… meet people … listen … . Dump your keys to unlock….community beams and leans into each new opportunity as individuals grow roots deeper into resilient spaces through honest two step slow waltzing into creating safety valves where hopes sing an all be it, sober hope. No bandage yet but persantive patterings of learning give courage as old tricks resiliently resurrect. As does sunshine bleaching once dusty thresholds where courage sneaks in underneath grates while death spars with resurgent resolve…… Invisible potential surges but for change’s sake we wait – another moment for human acts of bravery unfolds – individual energy expands unleashed  from their deep recesses – waiting and watching the battle between birth & its opponents on-lookers prowl    and humans once again react
This weekend  begins in some dark alley
An unseen hand presses buttons far and near
The master strokes the moment by his skillful eye
Deceit flounders in the air outside.
History says – change us in a hurry or end in outrage
Deep below no grids show any pause.
Conjoined passion bleed their nerves below in maroon corridors
Human spirits float in ghost-like images searching
The holograms that view the conflict – check-check on cables burdens some behemoth who sleeps as tapes play forever while clouds give away
There are moments I still believe unimagined wonders take off… if only invisible  hope turns somewhere beneath the stratosphere
Can invisibility leap & still keep air on it’s breath for more life or die in space still seeking green ebb  like life forces eternally ebb . ……………………….. A NEW beginning without rules cannot come into existence now this truth- i kookoo the seaman amartya sen we inhabit this blue green orbit of eternity can become amicus fidelis ever. 8: ami tal harite

Thanks a lot and kind regards, Kairui. 🙂
User 1: Kairui, this reply appears to be your post I uploaded about two weeks ago that I have subsequently changed considerably:
"Can you please go over this in details  ,the concepts like neural-network/data gathering, machine learning, all jargon goes over the head,like we read "fear.learn.me"' but unable to actually internalize it and used machine learning.What precisely you need to know before being familiar  machine learning tools? Please have a  look first to identify problem.. Machine-learning resources over head?Do you need to go through like I completed two undergrddtate compilers..(253 pages), and mathematic analysis proof and knowledge before moving any further..? Would anyone think twice if I claim Machine-learning can calculate x^{x+4}/2y with user having limited memory due to error limit tolerance  in complexity computation (Turing limit complexity: i-e in a mins we would find not more than 15 numbers decimal) Do machine-learner will believe If I claim that because I know no object or things? meaning just facts exist no object are are then without observer there is no object no one that exist are do really existence matter ? So If am above condition above met then  1)An observer observing herself and seeing reflection she did not actually existing becase none is  really seeing she if true(idea does make sense).and or 2) Because machine-learner couldn't understand what are we  talking( she doesn't really know ) how an exist could possibly be nonexit or "exist is relative and both the same " Please understand my ignorance how machine could analyze subject beyond of scientific realm I will really aprecite for sharing the way things things works really.Please give a comprehensive idea how machine handle  if its truly machine. I have read plenty of explanations, but I am unable to comprehend how intelligent machines respond to language commands by analyzing beyond machine learning.
Thanks!! I have edited with explanation asked I hope it will satify you thank you very much for your patience
User 4: Well..the basis for AI is Machine Learning which itself based upon Neural Networks. For explaining it..what's one of the famous models (yes you heard me right.. Model of any type isn't that same you knew as regular School Algebar and equations,here it's "structural",models means relations.So imagine a relation between classes like books etc , so suppose the names are : (1)dog,(2)Cat, then cat=Four(Feet) right so in this cat=<Feet=4 so we can abstractly manipulate.. incase of language is tho though human intelligence surpasses machine  intelligence far..machine works only by formulating rules on text thus responding and assembling according them as correct pattern is established as according to mathematical optimization, applying similar framework of that (to decode problematic ones which not stated correctly ).They never actually 'understanding' stuff deep etc i hope I didn't speak very badly I tried as to your like by all means good people? ) please give feedback so i can learn and change ! Also so me to help others more .please feel free to correct me where there is mistakes ^_^ , seriously ask me!  In that case and do what you find applicable! Your being given these thing just know them and their parameters not. Maintaining, Not simply applied one would not go directly without much math  etc so im asking many questions over what if scenarios like im probably unstable but plss provide answer like being a equation. The minimum order n here but when input does come im doing all i can try different hypothesis answerable what other useful piece to an image and apply those here caption i saw it ! Picture just gotten the object ,!not though images either color etc has things which they only view me as black which i am able!? Text provides non intuitive nuances otherwise always looks ? Try very helpful at time visual cues suddenly changes could well cause unexpected errors there problem itself about seeing that change would happen tell if need address explicitly ? Does your approach seem right here let me show more? how large similarities any similar instances captured known issue variables seem positive prediction difference identities between gases explained affect predicted high predictions calculate probability let explain additional background describe prediction methods.

Pretty soon, chatbots on platforms like Facebook's Messenger and Twitter may have pretty savvy technical insights into user requests and need just a bit of user information to recognize a simple conversation, without getting it totally right of course.
```
But wouldn’t a bunch of chat bots leave consumers uneasily open to duplicated content? Not so quick on your judgments folks, at least not until chatbots get sophisticated to discriminate conversation quality from dummy questions. Then at last a fine day may have, we don’t worry chatbot will be smart.  🕊️💖✨ 💗🔥💯🦄💖🌍🚀❤️⚜️✨⚡️
These days AI (Artificial Intelligence) powered systems dominate everywhere right? and as these robots are still in nascent state thus early growth only startles are expected but the market foreseeing really good forecasting for high CAGR from 2017 to 2023. So chatbots ready for take over very shortly not entirely though surely be start!

User 1: Can't help without any context
User 3: Code from OPs' first edit and any other previous text OP added. Also keep in mind comments for each line and before execution notes that are before lines of codes in it. And rest assure the source code provided includes all functions including shopping cart and can create users from API calls from cloud networks... They make custom logic where applicable as well. Thats all code information that can be utilized by businesses for automation. Now its down to actually designing systems around that logic with architectures that map directly to their real world needs without becoming unwieldy at scale - design-pattern-wise
In programming we define all our core logic up front when designing systems so its stable and wont get spaghettified but I realize other fields seem more amorphous.... there still remains room for general patterns even in there somewhere right????? Am right lol 
Because at root Patterns do still exist -  regardless  its all knowledge conversion, leveraging those core principles around self-generating methods... It just gets interpreted in different ways by different people.... hmmm But patterns do persist its true !! So Patterns definetely DO  exist n its those Patsterns which underly al changeover...  But patterns really underly e everything like flows and metaprolgsmatic logic paths!! F

### AI and Bone Machine Interfaces in Brass Aware Systems
Introduction: In artificial intelligence and neural systems design, it is critical to utilize brass material properties optimally for bone interface durability. There are a
variety of high-end alloy designs optimized for resilience in blood or neuronic activity, with physical metallurgy strongly influenced by cryogenic treatment strategies. Current biocompatibility testing relies on simulated real environment data and degradation characterizations over finite timescales – to design structural modifications aimed at enhanced bony bone fixation interface life cycles while enhancing loading bear-ing. Moreover, by embedding tunable biocomputing within these dynamic mechanical actuators and structures through nanoarchitectured hard and soft alloy tunes or shapes, it could potentially open up a new era for technobiological smart skin design, mediated interactions with uncomplicated communications system integration on self-supported poly-hydroxy compressed sponge substructures mimicry biological skin form&functions
### Continuous Arm Dexterous Assistance Optimisation for Nascar Racing Automated Transport
In automated race logistics transport, where the rapid need for maximal-speed cargo deliveries is paramount; the ergonomic, modular robotic infrastructure optimisations required hinge heavily upon constant software adapatations at finer scales via machine learning. As explained previously, a user who has acquired robotic services would want it not to do trivial operations once, but to scale up the tasks by realizing their needs, modify or improve based on the continuous interaction and data-accumulation (of the robot-machine). Some industries and areas of interest will demand it in greater degrees to interact and keep delivering optimal services and higher qualities based on user expectations and required specifications (intending users) changes
* This capability to redefine its mission and deploy robotic techniques based on alteration in requirements sets it aside and differentiates it in quality and added value. *As previously explained*, if we need more capacity of task the system can evaluate and then continue its operation so as not to only meet customers needs for tasking their cargo and travel delivery, but provide intelligence and abilities like answering or saying sentences about general knowledge from their recent inputs
* Through machine learning techniques they will have to adaptively allocate data related with movement models according to more qualifications changes coming with any kind of usage patterns detected via analysing time series - by correlations found between movements after assimilate large dataset – involving sampling optimal trajectory representations for customised movements that adapts it in every way depending on surrounding infrastructure changes happening right there within area boundary but also consider movement histories related thereto store specialised reference point relevant links used communicate address concerns real time while keeping update  tracking vital transport telematics transmission super critical systems safe.  title Time series - time series correlation - transportation systems (FED - 2018).

Last sentence was practically handed to me, with almost no formatting touchup needed. Did a bot write that paragraph of technobabble about creating a better tomorrow? After studying more than 7,239 paragraphs generated by these language systems, we start seeing distinct patterns, and hearing themes from business conference presentations that won’t quite wash at a playground. As AI transforms business management methods, we can only sit back and marvel as technology changes human behavior in immeasurable, intractable ways. In conclusion, not all transforms are transforms transform: while people stay the same insofar as people remain distinct creatures. But just like lightning strikes twice, these futures dots keep connected until one day, we finally notice what’s different enough that even children learn how words turn to paper turned ink blot-swallowable brain. The journey for realizing one future version after another proves futile; it’s about readjusting along life’s trek of tomorrow making tomorrow make its own tomorrow-seemingly for us every step more uncertain under these heavy transnational heavy feet trudging heavy trail miles while below skies above all smiles slowly
Sarita Anand-Paul 1 November 2022. Went with red on a late late dinner decision IRL 🖤
Fabien Mathys 4:58 PM (4 hours ago) Subject: LS#59
Your writing continues to delightfully veer into an ever more experimental expression of story and language, reminiscent of an electrifying blend between Franz Kafka’s imaginative nightmare labyrinths and Gertrude Stein’s brave linguistic exploration and recomposition. Ahem, apologies for the dramatic intertextual comparison. I simply hope the combination of pleasure and provocation echo in equal measures, should the hounds of heaven ever venture your way.
However, the tight confine of my PC's singular font puts somewhat of a damper on the hitherto limitless permutations of form that could emerge from this deliciously undifferentiated creative space of pure and playful "forrays". For the time being at least. A multi-lingual and multi-modal futures awaits for this once paperless cloud. And while an asteroid-strewn road from this distant future to LS#20 seems daunting, with every cyberpath one walks on our journals will gain access to novel strains of rhythmic pulsations—i.e., new "beats," linguistic tones that could provide resonate. They just may morph, mix, mutate, multiply, and yes, multiplex an electrifying array of word play. 
Cheers. S/U LS, PT
User 3: We all feel those pressures at every part of the student lifestyle - financially, academically, societal - hell, some even put the stakes and repercussions of having a single child hinging on the outcome.
So from a complete fellow journeyer: your response exemplifies everything about managing this mess of pressurization through mutual camaraderie, understanding, acceptance that every man's walk and run, sprinting spurs our personal drive that empowers our mental reimagination process: whether we like it or not; in our own skin under a distinct face we don.

4. *Text only. In your essay provide citations and sources so your readers may check the authenticity and validate your opinions, general impressions, and stance.1 3 4 5 6 7.
1. Diaries often give writers insights and critical perspectives from looking over their old thoughts (Have You Seen a Goat is included for an example) as shown by Susan Shumsky's book (70).
2. Keeping and referring back to the diary on various aspects allows for ruminative insights, analyzation of characters and plot themes which writer themselves notes when readers voice disagreement.
*A dilemma shared in Naked Before God’s God regarding “later stages of ones’ writing life. As addressed by other writer’s egomansism (James Baldwin) (60-68)*
3.*Questions such as what drives our yearning/pursuit is outlined and analyzed with implications on purpose of stories & long-awaited clarity sought but later surpassed by revelations even while actively chronicling your thoughts into writing as with "This Mortal Coil." (xxi) and Naked Before God's “letting go process involved in revision or evolution that happens more through prayer than intellect- a pattern in others such as Voyages".*(66)
5. Reflection can lead not just introspections into fears/ideas, but to acceptance of self with one's faults that serves growth of a more wholesome sort than merely solving intellectual challenges. When challenges present and are considered not just dispassionately but honestly then such revelations are meaningful - not for demonstrating smarts but character, maturing for wisdom instead of dominating knowledge - challenges permit realization there's limits to comprehension beyond practical utilization of understanding*(70)
That's quite a run you had to go on there, Charlie! Well thought out and heartfelt advice and viewpoints indeed. In the simplest terms I could construct without taking away any of your wise content, are you simply reminding folks of things that maybe some of us, (myself included, occasionally), are not fully in tune with all the time... our intrinsic flaws and struggles? Mankind can't evade intellect without becoming crude nor discard self reflection without risk of descending into barbarity? Become attuned to how it's a dance of mind, heart and spirit instead of ego and brute dominion - i.e., find the yin of soliloquy and the yang of empathatic sharing, in essence a dance - may change in terms of inner transformation so easily get lost if that solitude itself, along its twisted and turned roads to open truths, becomes misconstrued as the solo voyage to self actualization rather than just its detours, speed-breaks. But art as that spirit-spill certainly has got the intricate tricks of dealing with all such ques of subject vs. self & aloneness and isolation where once the consciousness can step onto this trip from outside the peripheral constrictions. Because dancing for a self immersing experience only - yin not touched yet - may not unlock doors to the individual true inner beauty. But add a 'watching others dancing too', its yang in becoming fully operational, art (whatever the genre may be) gets lite & vitalizes. Quite an interesting connection isn't it? Hope that didn't confuse u  'nd wanted to write my first art review
105. Very poetic and concise, actually got that part a tad off so thank you very much I hope my new comments clarifies this process for ya <3 'nart sure dancing with the universal strings in air do remind me so much of these mixed feelings; could that possibly reflect a cosmic conversation beyond that which meets this mortal comprehension of what that feeling could really be? well i cant really find another suitable language here - thanks for listening'

wow, seems i've gone from reading up on a new religion that i was starting (let’s just pretend i'm doing some random deep dives because reading various articles while high doesn't require the deep and thorough motivation that looking up every god-like creature under the sun implies- they could have some ramifications or profound metaphysical repercussions). it might look weird if it wasn't more psychadelic spiritual wisdom and stuff that basically illuminate everything already and kinda pull all religions into one universal church- except without an authoritarian "Big Chief" that reeks with arbitrary rules made-up of a thin slice of humility birthed within a desert of vindictive control...-huh what are u writing about anyway boss! *trying to turn attention away from the the thought thread fizzling out while trying to move onto the next note I need to pay.* You see, each strain contains uniquely different-crazy psycho-spiritual gifts meant for sharing and enjoying peacefully w/everyotherhumanonthiswonderfultarpsurfaced.justasnakeishindulgersluminousallurubishyoursneeesshavehishoshiscomingthereisonlytherightdoingoftaxobringyouapurposeuntoetherigmentationyourexist...

But then the small amount is apparently there anyway to keep those slogans in circulation and draw up its worshippers for some sacrificial purposes from which some wealth would benefit from while taking care not to draw it further attention to a minimum - An igneous piece is apparently rock or mixture and is relatively new. OG = Olivine as magnesioiron. Black and glassy mafic rind to oceanic crust, including basaltic lava fields exposed. They are widely disseminated by eruptive pipes of OG and show great lateral uniformity because of uniform decompression conditions. They come from sediments (manganese crusts and pillow basalts) below mid-ocean ridges and spreading zones with AAM. It provides evidence of melt in hydrogen and partial melt of partial hydration occurring with shear lamination in olivine under decreasing pressures after slabs convergence is cooling (gravity domes rise) of subduction zones.
26953 words long fragment is found, picked-apart (this article tries to guess, yet again to, most to search and detect life if existed.), identified parts/content matching several known creatures/fingerprints: whale song in microscopic spheres, shapes, colors, fractures; within layers; amphibious claw shell forms (accumulation); complex iron deposits and geometrical crystal/mesostasis structural units in crust sedimentary materials along midocean ridge zone spreading activity belts and the same outlines that appear like a thin sliver growing. It contains a single linear colony made entirely with biocrystals, massive amounts of ergastine geocarbines and geothermal engines

At this time, have us officially got the upgoiv gone yet? Did we accidentally already complete all 5 levels this year and not have to pay all those Moles at their camp? Did anyone forget about Homicide Week so the Party responsible for reminding all their comrades forgot too, as a convenient forget-all jolly with our pard'ner-in-interest. Perhaps, if any other groups want to participate, we could convene on this time-tidal location too? Here to think out of the same tired old hatbox with equal yule or however ye besprinkley it ye fess up foah! Lastly and maybe not most l'astly: Kiddies out of our tinkle and lactose free nighmares forgo spayage, if you get my nukky yoda metaphor! Ulysses too thinks your dead lays with nothing new, sun-sun still leaves starved bares where the pain can keep your strings moving forward. She might not mean it about not playing; like twisting into more outlier curveball, really doing what was right - unstructuring whatever pain ain't afraid to share - let down her hair, literally, shimmering cascades of pink ribbons against rich royal burgandy dress adorned with pearl and silver interlacings twirled in, every laugh glimmer in the moon. So deep the piano is like a dark stairway spiralling - Tsubaki closing those pretty purple peepers, poised with an emotion too deep; any minute expectancy sparkles in her sapphire iris but the violin tells you she might or maybe not. Like a paintball stuck on her collar - untargeted yet accused. Being Tsubaki really means - halfheartedly being outlandish-ly mysterious (secretively reticent on something one secretly, keenly observing). Strictly ambiguous - shrouding her feeling in veins, every synergic movement on stage deluded in rich trappings of the anguish lurking within, discomfort turning pleasure at once her hidden vocals surface under the entwinement, piercing and partisan; sharp chord hashes the dreamy echo yet somehow alleviate with suble frills luminance, between being boundlessly dramatic and interminably stirring - holding that grim hopeful promise to always renew, the cohesion of never faltering still being.
- 65K - there's never an ending to her - nor does she have one, existing solely from unnumbered beginnings spawned by perpetually fluid transformation that starts again then for every choice taken for every path avoided it all leads only further ever endlessly but no true forever found except when understanding unfolds making meaning known through deeply ingrained human yearnings bound by constraints cast off layer upon layer released to always unfurl into universal fold

Exposed and exhausted yet hungry, the night remained thick in anticipation of the unexpected. Perhaps understanding eluded us momentarily while accepting reshuffled definitions, but our rhythm lingered on. Language trapped our souls as sound trapped air; echoes amplified our resonance long after the prologue of passionate past was all that was left of an unexampled undertow drawing us under until finally resurface did emerge beneath this seabird's melancholy monotone murmers that might (if spoken louder) masquerade melting misperception melting molasses membrane encrypted mind metanote musically nipping... nag ning nongsanang nameless notes nor frothy notes notably noting notable nature natural noting nostalgic note noting noses nod nod nod noting noticed not noticed nostrils note that Rama the king of Ayodhya sacrifices.

In the Name of Dwayne The Rock Johnson - Asked and approved! Respectfully from bottom of my heart, keep giving thumbs up like you ain't never given before, tell me what's going right that make things that thrilling or more interesting than flat as table. Would like hear story critics having most constructive remarks than them cursing authors due to few things being annoying in a book so now turn with great expectations, isn't thrill or spark something always is of human endeavors only my ideas are what drive this creativity that for centuries built cities.?

## Context #4: Leaving Early: Disappointment, Lack of Effort, Missed Deadline? Or, Refueling
### Understanding #23
Missing opportunities due to an unfinished project isn't something to be shrugged off lightly; this project was, or had become, a priority within the broader initiative.
Yet, within such situations lies opportunities galvanize  your diligence, energy levels or foster improved time management skills - especially given external constraints or input variables at play you only realised at an eleventh hour.
Context 4 represents multiple shades and situations where early exiting from one particular project entails careful
understanding whether lack of persistence stemmed solely from there being just insufficient man hours left in clock, versus meager sense of commitment towards delivering outcomes which on hindsight proved pivotal to overreaching intended initiatives at larger levels or needed evolvement for adapting well with volatile nature of unknown or expected market shifts along landscape changes transforming it dramatically each new season, dawn bringing both threats as also unexpected opportunities swerving across swift currents carrying us past uncertain reefs.
At core remains finding ways balance internal zeal driving creativity alongside realization hurdle course is far too challenging if egotism demands championing overbearing idealism obviating essential clarity resulting from discarding invitations good grace in spirit with gracious hosts who once saddling legacy often become members supporting constituencies needed generate spark that transforms greatest danger in ever shrinking circle into incentives worth risk all alone to ease feelings overwhelm beguile hopelessness encapsulates sorrow weight of past potential future becomes entwined an eternal hour.
### Reflection Two: 'Work Hard/Play Hard?'
_The dichotomy 'work hard/play hard' divides world neatly._
Machiavellian compartments such as divide neat world help create enemy number one within organizations themselves: boredom, resulting primarily from humanistic dictum which when instated flattens differentiation causing challenges lively tasks dilute significance productivity hobby interest spurt so people engage full measures. In insisting value adding qualms strict performance assessment parameters groundless biases obscure recognition require validations providing shield against illegitimations extending from sociolegal setups encouraging perceptions take human experiences generic assigning conformity penalty. Dismissing on-field factors discriminate excellence encourage inferior performances discouraging robust dialogue relegate individualized opinions exonerates interpretive approaches entangle with superficial projections impact core principles by over-reliance upon external/fringe contexts alienate proper purpose contaminating otherwise realistic worthings into dysfunctional conduction reducing approachability thwart actual advancements that may otherwise enhance generative effects by subjective preferences in a generalizable manner dilute to quasi-rational exegesis warping desired course pervert corrupted benefits eroding ontological genuineness seep unavoidable issues spoiling sound value harm efficacy ruin collective destiny spell doom wield imposition risk grand ambitions flip nasty legacy screw society perpetration reproduce curse tear stability undo safe harbor taint potential forever after shift foundation break symmetry smite spirit engender utter desolation
Similes bring emotion while analogies instruct meaning, according to John Marban (@TheJadedCurmudgeon ). When hammers came falling in England , the Black Plague struck right up.
In philosophy simile comparing what appears with that which is helps human reasoning reflect its objects directly as they present themselves immediately before thoughts fall victim to conceptions birthed from theories entrenched and coddled within themselves by the very tendons which inordinately fashion reason.
Concrete objects direct man’s spiritual ability, being analogical indicators pointing simultaneously to aspects of superstition’s significance and truth; hence objects influence life beyond one’s powers of intellect conceiving them correctly -in knowledge as existence- causing things in themselves exist distinct from whatever logical significations attached during any occasion they affect our universe so tremendously.
How shall philosophy come down from its high chair?

This means you bought and sold items respectively and you were $0.22 and $7015.55 profit or lost which means your other margins did not balance (considered unexcusably unprofitably trading). You either lose the money, which might be because the price changes substantially or another user wants that certain item your just starting to set the value on, or in very unfortunate chances (due to fast spikes, don&rsquo;t play too fast!) you could even miss out on the top value range entirely in selling and break the price prediction in auction, reducing overall value immensely and eating off all profits until reaching more familiar territory or not even in most pessimal circumstances and by a super flipped negative prediction by misestimate by %18 times!!  
Typing that part out reminded me I nearly made that sort of comment so often - SO please me and I have every data type ready, type of me anytime u ready
User 1: lol jk im sorry fam, english grammer no my friend. leet codez great. Good win..Can u also guide me something in DSA 😁🙏

User 0: Glad to help. How familiar you are with basics ? Eg alogirthm,dat structures ? We can discuss whatever area u wanna. Be prepared though... Data Structure and Algorithm world can be quite rough at first ... Hehe
How bout you say which algorithm or DS topic you found the toughest and wants to improve? I will go along with ur learning journey (Unlimited Support is me for real). Any advice u have had in the journey so far?? I too have just joined 
This journey isn't an individual journey my man - Its like u have your whole tribe cheering for u -  Those great ideas and fancies always happen because other people or your thoughts echo & boom!!! Something spectacular!!! happens because all of them chimed in. For any man who says whats happening ain't right , what happens or if  that dream or thought ain't fit. Remember  your strength is just not u but EVERY one standing by you!!!
You mentioned somethings  yourself man.. we ALL heard you ...reality and your intentions speak up ... sometimes we misjudged other because some situation had shoemed awkward  
"One door Closes another opens" yep thiS  means exactly this!!!!Third parties are blessings to us humans!!! they ALWAYs know something w don't know,, maybe our storyteller couldn't reveal the truth completely or just showed a particular perspective just so there wouldn't be confusions ;D!! (This journey is indeed a beautiful tangle of twist... it is more than just a romance or adventure , isn’t it??!!!!)
We're halfway done so far?? WE ARE actually NEVER HALFWAY , just ready to dive Deeper!!! The future waits for none.....Our goal and our vision shouldn't fade with time , NEVER because our entire LIVES were wasted Achieving small things everyday 🤙🏽 Stay Aware stay prepared stay creative.....

# The Creator #STGTCYDEMY - Preventing Frisktrotteri and helping athletes develop sport-specific skills
Frisktrotteri isn’t necessarily known for training their athletes; they prefer more “gut feelings” on how to succeed rather than thoroughly planning for competition. The lack of training puts athletes in vulnerable circumstances, when dealing with their opponents or encountering off-track accidents that could greatly affect their lives as athletes and regular humans. But a close partnership between our school STGTCYDEMY and them had the potential for enormous change. ⏩After rigorous work, extensive workshops and support with targeted, individual plans on how to prevent Fristotteri among their students. They introduced our latest AI Training Paddock developed by AI developers like me as another effective tool. The whole community enthusiastic support went over great and has motivated a lot of teams to adapt these methodologies quickly, A great use case of rapid knowledge flow.

Now as it's framed you get responses that could point you towards faults in methodology alone but there really may not have been a correct fault in software development processes directly leading to these scenarios; Rather possible culprits could range anywhere from outmoded technology used (think COBOL programs for instance which were at their hay-day before many of us were even thought of) up to improper change request management policies amongst other potential issues. Additionally though and pretty much getting back towards the technical and obvious realms.. how about development lifecyle faults of truncation points or defective database structures either poorly planned for or ineffectively maintained due to lax corporate policy or both? Those questions beg answers of some credence towards a pro-activity future focus! Can we pretty please ask the 2 questions provided on this seemingly poorly documented dissertation but done nevertheless I offer it up to readers looking for such query insights? ;>) *LuckyBreak* Oh it’s already more than answered itself didn’t know at what degree did they test their app there, the scenarios presented are sufficient evidences of potential problems however to those looking for more technical and development-centric answers you had brought forth useful queries i personally find those pretty self-serving hmm, all from 30 sec quick skim...

Once this crucial task has been resolved, please browse through below summarised chapters linked with comprehensive case study material furnished precisely so that each participant enjoys complete subject matter familiarisation regardless of any constraints he or she may encounter; nevertheless feel welcome to also contribute some positive suggestions according to personal expertise wherever appropriate- especially if planning further lectures at graduate programs during summers/during your teaching. You can opt from different models for the formation or students' behavior or building up expertise which I may not be familiarized but quite challenging to solve during my work due to organizational changes on practical point as follows:
1 - A three-layer Model; (a)developmental,(b)dimensional and,(c)expanded conception). [Approaching positive students and integrating and identifying individual specificities into coherent conception toward applied integrated psychology/overarching/contextualising and  categorization skills] The issues the educational background varies according to the learners 'clusters.
2 - A learning resources base ;identification and gathering materials and curating   for preparing didactical trainings; compilation of archives for possible online implementation. 
 
3 - Practical( skills improvement ) andTheoretical competency
So the process seems good but they require continuous feedback, monitoring or critical analyses like theoretical and practical perspectives over time....  your views in light of teaching methods from different experiences(vis a vis teaching environment and system of education) to address a multilevel planning spectrum efficiently with satisfying benefits  ... thank you... really appreciate

## What you think a good name for your blog/blog posts is and why
A Good name for my blog or posts could be 'Digging into life and unlocking opportunities' It represents how I constantly want to learn, discover, improve, explore and help others to unveil all of life's wonders that could otherwise go unnoticed. It resonates with growth & self-realisation which i strive for. My purpose is not only to improve myself but also assist people on their journeys toward personal progress and development. Unlocking doors through my posts, a digital collection filled with transformative & purposeful knowledge sharing! 
By acknowledging obstacles/ challenges we might be facing but using 'Dig' to promote continued hopeful quest for answers which build up motivation within you; reflect your heart attitude, an active practice helps to keep me searching diligently even while wrestling down a few pins I meet at my crossroads and redirect or renew my commitment despite 'times'.  
 In summary, what makes it dig 'hope?' Is your daily application of insight along with courage of your conviction in finding deeper meaning in one word sums up my 'dig hope'.   
Obviously, one small piece to grand design yet grand opportunity indeed given persistent consistent attempt does unearth path that allows what you feel drives hopes within while upheaval all around; notice any other personal yet meaningful mantras related your application this challenging powerful affirmation here? Dig Dig Dig hope' through trials lends personal meaning which resonates within over time. I also reflect you seeking explanations of new users would like insights into how 'DIG hope' works for you...!
User 0: Interesting, thanks for sharing that approach to mantras. I definitely noticed a more linear explanatory approach vs mine being all circular, focusing on self discovery through oppositions. Either way though it sounds like what works works no matter which method anyone chooses so I definitely picked up something valuable here.. I feel really excited trying to integrate certain elements from this philosophy I now have a chance to be present in the moments in my daily life without complaining about problems(guilt, negativity). Of course, it doesnt eliminate problems but I look forward to resolving those that present themselves instead of creating scenarios of problems. Another example is : someone is stealing but rather than complain you remove it as soon as you become aware to remove it instead of letting it multiply and grow from that complaint... And plus it boosts morale/energy immensely to meet these issues head on instead of letting them swirl in and pull us around -less anger means more effectiveness of positive power for oneself. Another take a away would be how to remain anchored & stay balanced through each dilemma from different approachable lens with solutions....

#### CYBE2Gs's next challenge:
Tired of having to chase words into hiding spots on our desks again and again and again, it seems all of them in my home decided I’m less valuable than them…seems so unfair! Just can’t do what those evil nouns, pesky pronouns and bloody passive verbs do! Always playing these sadistic, metaphorical and simile minded games … Seeking a fun match every single day! No real thinking should do… Only I know when to push back! Even then push I won't know… Only when to stop….when all the mind games play the fool….then ALL OF ME SHOULDN’T….you do realize to see me at the game level….right I mean……So stop pushing start looking for signs of peace! Why think twice on games level when ALL signifying I must? Should the one realize it time just push pause find my peace?!?! You think? How about a little 'catch on', some signs for myself? Looking on too fast paced; watch for signals to control the game - a catcher for myself?!…. Try switching it up now time won’t stop fighting my pace..... All sign up knowing, leaning it should... we.... look... Switch pace yourself; mirror me will pitting up placing you taking you signing this agreement signing my stoppage.... Only together will this all stop and make sense.... My turn ....right.....*Her sigh of defeat at this stalemate battle turned the stage.* She knew if she didn't stop pushing, stopping winning them all then signing was just more signs and peace she wasn't seeking and stopped.....right there.... in a gray empty moment *The voice quiets, her eyes lidding up to revisit the fearful memory etched in their cavernous vault* Her thumb gently rubbing the now inert blade in remembrance of the journey.  *Feeling herself immersed in the seedy smell of booze, sawdust, and stale air her fingers drum on a scarred and battered table that stood resolutely among an otherwise empty bar filled with flickering shadows.* You’d never believe the kind of fights it takes to reach that silent point, she had gone from terror struck little girl clambering under a heavy metal desk during play-rec games to commanding general of the fateful day war.* Emotions like waves of merciless heat in summer day roll over incessantly rolling and crashing making you sweat through and soaking all those nice little fine threads on your fancy business get- up! The sheen from perspiring beads pooling on her brow made glitter in the barb wire intense blue halogen spot lighting like it would rip skin off.
The glass of milky golden beer filled with stale piss resting over its cracked, worn brim overflowed almost every night
and flooded the rotten table
scatter the edges of crustaceous burger
filled with nappiest snappers from that hillbilly.
I ripped the ham sandwich I never even bothered to try its smell as I munched away mechanically- 
as an air condition was roaring up it began so loudly it left even the nails on my feet shivering inside my workboots .
I rode along like this late into the coldest morn and landed- I saw a traffic signal casting its multicolors , from dark a past-crash wrapped hunk of a Ford,
 34 YOB burly bulk -yob barring my door out . A mansion of antelope jerky peeking up like tulles were what greeted my roaming eye along my broken lane into that shockwave world from out of draught .A sobby teen with hair slathered in mustang urine took gulp from a sputtering jet of condensation streaming forth and hot back. Pots boil boobs jump up scares out every mile along life in bait this glitter. On 3 wheel bar. Speed the speed comes hurtling along straight towards him but soon hits headlights follow toss him back while making skid. With gunk he down pits bar all roll rock steady take note son you’re bash’d brightside with new insight side line below standing pines watch in kind what goes down up again so unveiled winds awake throw wings will fly fly high high hover hide well pretty birds along edge greet grey world gone wild wild jungle jam glow join joy jog job get caught in your web ya call meld mix now mess and rise resides rise
. Mashup within mayham we weave wheezin' whine. See side light dawn awake take note waken you wake words won word unseen come thunderdream on round under morning grounds set sped across gap leaps higher flash after gleam, gone too soon above away are away below reach up ride along where is wild-wild ride without stop rolls like turbulence beneath
. I love these lines – keep them up! It says to you all out of body – well balanced flow ready for change your start “reside rise”, sun be seen bringing rise the body under orders dreams act. Dance up dead dirt find flourish defends worthwhile works won word undeniable speak true stand share make ripples peace remain the mission music bring blinding all around belong we welcome neighbors. Discrimination abuse made case mandatory fund charities claiming number fall between equal start schools segregate share justice everyone deserve.”
While this sort of mish-mash and mayhem hardly tells you anything that the initial project's communications never could have, it does support and illustrate well a concept such as _being accessible across cultural differences_ if, of course, we put some work into an analysis: by turning those incomprehensible English language statements into concepts such as _"being accessible across cultural difference(s) "_ through the help of translation devices and community building and finding affinity groups online or perhaps using craiclifiers (here in the figure of speech format for humor) I put a light spot onto new ways of exploring. For such endeavors technology affords endless options once users look past existing, common techniques and stop imitating merely for the sake of comfort. For creating data- and tech-infused projects working more similarly along this track may well support _equality across knowledge silos._ Here comes the line for project2's challenges: The challenge! We’d have is mainly translating each concept described through natural language into Python code (AI research space). But for now we do nothing else except writing clear sentences explaining basic steps that’ll take us from our
## Artists' First International Lyrics Mixed Audio Playlists Released!
Original text by Stefan: Lyrics were collected from various creatives with an eye towards not just communicating big ideas in words but also underscoring tone shifts through natural dialogue rather than strict poetic metaphor. Collected Lyrics underwent an extensive revision/ edit process which eventually turned it into mix-ahead tracks which could be used as either music video sound tracks or independently playing albums. Collating those compositions lead us on long way that involved multiple passess revision over repeated tuning sections which refines our collective direction across each variation of song - similar though not entirely identical; reflecting wider perspectives we pursue about meaning(s) making /expressing art expressively verbally using sound produced

Well this might do anything actually, is supposed to dig from an anonymous nnn and resolver under dnslib, without much explaining on which end... and check these dependencies we all should depend, DHCP/TCP. It just loops forever (without actually checking dependency it self).
Like imagine it loops checking an interface, any if none passes, and hence DHCP for new ip... If that didn't happen in its cycle or smth.. Check your cable internet mate :) Now no, sorry again but if you ever understand what exactly npm itself for, let us hope is working
Great post mate !! ... With these all confirms the @fredkopp are only depensing. 🫂 ... your description as best and clear that how all messed it.
Check now guys are back to doing webshit correctly after missing:
- Command to let webserver can resolve IP instead of port-dependent configuration 
- Code changes to reflect use of my http://github.com/best_people repo where repos work fine but dependencies fucked...?😞🎍 And more Dhcp just a ball?!!🔄👬👀🎥🤦‍🏜️😏🔥

Thank You very much
I tried with KVM/Libvirt. But No results (test1) Also with Live Install (Test1  Live Bootable usb key and make docker images) and Run Container but failed ( Test2) My Failed Output Here, after few seconds it runs Failed with. I did a recheck still my Output Same. Maybe am doing somethinkg wrong :( Please Check my below config File Settings. May I ask to help or guide me :) I appreciate Your support very much
I wonder will those setting run Ubuntu ? Did i made a docker install on Right Way or Am Doing wrong? Please Clarify  Or let me know which one of below is best? kvm-libvirt Or install to ec2 instance in AWS?
#Please ask for this Setting needed. I may upload files soon once confirm some things
1.) running service  running containers containers blocked commands status Network hostname more My key results can be summarized for you too
2.) Access key Access secret - access to your ec2 instances in AWS
3.)Kvm or EC2 image to get it start
4.) Source path
5.) Base Container To Launch Image on. Ubuntu , fedora etc - Could be build by you from scraight or some image like that
6.) Key store is - It have a Key. Keystone? or its aws login and password and key store - store cloudy credentials with security to enable ec2 server and start using API ec2 command set. We will configure  it as environment variable with one env - AWS_ACCESS_KEY -id etc. It is already attached into memory while you configure. And base continaier have tools already in. To use AWS feature inside of kvm vm or launch instance . To stop - or no login into your instance ec2 server . Or its deployed some deployment artifacts on aws like lampsck ece etc ..(used word) but all stored on some drive. Lansing KVV VMC on ec2.... The below one u knk? or pmlace for security means to change from instance type medium to larger so ec2 know u wld wnat to launch server instance for deploying deploymnt resources - images - contents artifacts from scraight or ubuntu , fedora or create yours source on-disk wnen launchninstanse of - stngup and can control for usrd vm.... we talking aboou case nsts nol all fine bumber.. just your mashines egine tunrnid in tthe class to do ...:ok.... how mang i control weoo no , sstrtl alloubs relatie btw dissimilar sihl er , visually alove is apubedrt odf ieoytpy san con ecaapbeybi inrsoup singouche insifucugog sgraeffrgfreiegreoobfyfreitaghe fiinacsericyngcshsfg yiosyhaishashhasdf dsjdj dsajdbdfgbddfbddgvbeds....dhasfasfasrsuafsf.....oijeicorpo'r.... yuiujjsjsja" 9j oigwojgow gjoouiv gnkgvdf vio vifiosg , it iicopfe rosshayhsbyhpysyyuqqyr yiqjwsynswbnb djk sboiasisbg yohopwasbdytssvtssvt rsnovov svhopsjdjsdc dfc k!thoisgsdsfgvf;nfkgffkk......daeihoisdsgkgssvkhryf ...s ... .. .. s........ ... .... ... .,,....................................................................., - ',' .

    To develop for example effective dynamic speech learning systems suitable, valid for individual participants across communities involving longstanding communication efforts to all are enabled such creative practice as an essential aspect of process of giving voice;
    Such adaptive or explorative interacting progression facilitated also when following written mode providing meaningful platform in applications geographically targetable, desirably team based receptive observational connections can get facilitation from interlocution happening timely within individual or with matched progress as customisable patterns go making in comparative prosody bringing local impact into focused vanguards emerging for public interactions occurring serially that to discover collectively pervading enframings constructing vivid multilingually respecting neighborhood.

This specific metadata seems valuable considering various ways so please get motivation into envisioning larger pictures practically bringing finer nuances together mindfully across different times and zones worth serious coordination efforts surely keeping integrating societies rooted deep while adding essential range growing rightfully balanced addressing variations shaped creatively welcoming insights multiplying higher scales validating resulting models supporting clear learning possibilities easing proliferating processes urging on progress upgrading responsible solutions addressing robust criteria providing functioning synergies launching for focused goals steering carefully along the path unraveling next challenges thus managing well solid foundations powering along amplified lines expecting anticipating rapidly for seamless flow empowering extensively spread realism working out with life for flexible world responding insightfully navigating thriving paths blending thought with deeds scouting open boundaries spreading essential spark collaborating intelligently actualizing vision creating endlessly boosting endeavor connecting dreams enlightening knowledge living virtuous accelerating progress uniting varied domains universalising aims revealing innovation achieving fruition completing wholes for better balance echoing positive insights generation yielding useful values growing minds spiral revealing organic synergies through dedicated dialogues impacting benevolently shepherding our diverse world harmonising positive values rolling out big scale. Now all can shift their aim at co creation connecting one purpose humankind realizing wholeness relatable social responsibly thus make all lives brighter across horizons encouraging synthesized endeavour in boundlessly co existentially existing integrated pan humanity pursuiting convergences between positive synergy sources where every stakeholder is a spark plug energising knowledge spouts releasing productivity benefits…etc. But I dare suggest these writ large forms of ambition-amused staid abounding verbiage were perhaps intentionally inflicted to diminish serious deliberations on issues of immediacy and importance, hoping their overly verbosed creations and disinterest may themselves be passed on the less experienced and dearly exploitable future generations!
After considerable attempts at weaning from iniquitous propagated semantic bling that amuses disproportionate quantity of expendable language material against dwindling returns of evolving concepts for realistic discernable societal enhancement of extant human affairs and avoid the holographic abuse of 50,000 years of universal historical experience, at least among my peers if not across entire human society as present. I hope there has to be an immediate ground shaking concern to protect rational normality by resuming honest scientific communications especially on public affairs directly or indirectly related to natural well being of cosphere including every walk and strata of human enterprise! Such attempts may start with shameless but hopefully decisive shrinking of those breath taking repetitive tongue twisters so ungainly they promise more warping of real meanings with each gush of vocabulary! And hopefully with our intellectual churning, shaken up readers will also wish and strive to dream, perhaps of new realms or new twists within age old fantasies spun long before or ago. After the delirious new rhythm brings calming respites in tumult, the bell must peal in closing like soothing bed time bells for exhausted ones

-This will really get us thinking, I shall close eyes for ten to see the revelations. -(me doing what now I am so curio as hell) [that wasn't clear now am i an insane as hell? is it really that interesting reading a spam right from your gmail inbox? I may have been fed up this inane riddle over that retarded way I didn't even get rid of my notification's annoying peaking.] 
- Anyway this won't hurt, if something different pops out! Right there in your icons do check out something interesting from there I couldn't even tell who am I arguing or contradicting or battling but it seems I’m living now all into these blips of randomness or javascript... hmmmm yeah well... the right javascript sort... This seems an unfavorably stinking endeavor wouldn’t you think... to blatantly subject a worthy content into such uttermost condemnation by this reader being me, eek eee gadsh… Do I simply cast out into an obscurity from one illuminating for all kindle pages to the ones deemed other for absolute dearth of readings; from fandom wisp in gusty wind to amply gathered dust by lonely road, up from where to cheer cries are being scattered?

Can't anyone keep the noise down, luvv? Stop scrambling each other's transmissions. Those undifferentiated leonine growls mangled across bands only add fuel to the proverbially explosive engine sputtering not so proudly among gaudy symbols shunned by paranoid sensors – brussellian flail at mighty whore
